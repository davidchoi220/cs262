David Choi Review for Team GG (Life manager)A) When I saw their vision statement, I realized that the app they have planned in mind is a lot like the one what we have in our minds. As college student, wise time management is crucial and our group came to an agreement that this app could actually help us keep track of our time while we are at Calvin. Their idea of making the app as simple (implementing a single button to start and end time) looked similar to ours. B) Their prototype didn’t have much but it was there and well implemented. Their sample app was a “hello world” app on android.
