A) The completeness of their application was as a point where I thought it was ready to be launched for the public. They implemented pretty much all of the user stories that they wanted in the first place and there was a huge improvement compared to the version they had during the usability test. The application was very user friendly and and user interface looked very professional and organized. 

B) Their presentation showed how the application is very functional. I was a little sad to find out that their data is only stored internally on their memory, but other than that, their presentation was strong and effective in showing the class the usefulness of their application.

C) Their final application was well organized and complete. I also found the code to be well organized with documentation where it was needed. Their presentation demo showed that using this application could actually help people manage their time better than how they would without it.
