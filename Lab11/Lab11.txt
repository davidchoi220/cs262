CODE FORMATTING: 22 Line Adjustments
STATIC CODE CHECKING:
	Android: 
		Accessibility: 
			Missing accessibility label: where minSdk < 17, you should provide an 'android:hint'
				added android:hint=""
		Correctness:
			Obsolete Gradle Dependency
				A newer version of com.android.tools.build:gradle than 3.2.0 is available: 3.2.1
		Internationalization:
				String literal in 'setText' can not be translated. Use Android resources instead.
					Used Android resources instead
		Usability:
			Use autofill:
				Missing 'autofillHints' attribute > added autofillHints Attribute
	Java:
		Declaration Redundancy:
			Use weaker declaration > private declaration
		Probable Bugs:
			String values are compared using == not .equals() > 
				(opSelected == "+") -> (opSelected.equals("+"))
	Spelling:
		TYPOS have been fixed

	Android:
		Correctness: A newer version of com.android.tools.build:gradle than 3.2.0 is available: 3.2.1
			Didn't bother to change this because I thought it was unnecessary and time consuming.
		Internationalization: Hardcoded string "Fetch", should use '@string' resource
			Extracted to string resource
		Typography: Replace "..." with ellipsis character
			... -> #8230
	JAVA:
		Code Maturity:Declaration redundancy
			Can be package-private > declaration changed to private
		Java language level migration aids
			'StringBuffer buffer' may be declared as 'StringBuilder'
				Changed StringBuffer to StringBuilder
		Probable Bugs:Variable 'playerJSONString' initializer 'null' is redundant
			String playerJSONString = null; -> String playerJSONString;
