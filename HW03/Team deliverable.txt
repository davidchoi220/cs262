A) Yes, from their presentation, I was able to see huge amount of updates from the last time I saw them. There were a lot of new features, and more user stories put into action.

B) They used the phone's hard drive to store their data and their demo showed that it was working the way they want it to. When data were stored , they were sorted by time automatically, making it easy for users to keep track of their events.  Their UI model looked very well organized.

C) Yes, their demo ran without any bugs or errors. It didn't crash and ran smoothly. The app had updated features compared to when the last deliverable was due. 
 
D) It was effective but I hoped that their UI would be much simpler. They needed some reorganizing of data input fields.
